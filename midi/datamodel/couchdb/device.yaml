# Example device configuration for Ventris Dual Reverb
# Consider an effects pedal that can be turned on/off and has effects you can adjust via knobs

  Name: VentrisDualReverb
  MidiConnectName: One Series Ventris Dual Reverb
  Description: Reverb effects pedal with two engines.
  Active: true

# The device has a midi implementation mapping midi CC values to effect parameters
# By default assume the parameter has values in a range 0-127, otherwise discrete values can be mapped via selectors
# e.g. the engine has 13 or so options, but time and pre-delay are continuous values 0-127
  MidiImplementation:
  - Name: ReverbEngine
    ControlChangeValueSelector: ReverbEngine
    ControlChangeAddresses:
      - Name: ReverbEngineA
        Value: 1
      - Name: ReverbEngineB
        Value: 27
  
  # similar for Time, PreDelay, EngineParam5, Size
  # ControlChangeAddresses map to midi CC address for all implementations of the device
  # ControlChangeValueSelector maps to selector for discrete values only otherwise ommitted

# The device model emulates the physical controls in this case 5 knobs: engine, time, pre-delay, engine specific param 1 & 2
# DeviceEffects is the state, set the value inline with changes to the device
